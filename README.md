# four-clojure

Discussions of various solutions to the 4Clojure challenges.

Rather than just sharing the solutions, or showing off how small a golf score can be attained (there lays madness), these solutions cover various different solutions and offers opinions as to those solutions in terms of readability, abstraction where relevant performance.

[My YouTube channel](http://yt.vu/+jr0cket) contains Live coding sessions of some of the 4Clojure challenges.

## Usage
